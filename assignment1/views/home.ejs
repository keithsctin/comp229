    <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
    <p>This is the web site built up since my third semester of Software
      Engineering Technician program. It aims to introduce me: my studies, hobbies, and mission.
    </p>
    <p>My mission is to attain the knowledge that professors convey in classes,
       master programming techniques, and apply the theory of agile software engineering
       in real world scenarios.
    </p>
    <p>For more information about me, please click "About Me" in the above menu.</p>
